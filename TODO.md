# TODOs

### Setup Script
- [ ] Consider adding color to output as indicator of hierarchy instead of just relying on whitespace since that cannot be controlled for output from commands

### Function Arguments
- [ ] Enforce minimum number of function arguments with helpful usage messages on error
- [ ] Update README to use standard notation like seen in `man` and `--help` for arguments' lists of functions

### New Functions
- [ ] `git_install`: takes repo url, directory, and branch name, makes sure repo from url exists at directory with given branch pulled to latest
- [ ] `ensure_file_exists`: self-explanatory, combo of `ensure_containing_dir` and `touch`

### Oh My Posh Theme
- [ ] Make background of filler line transparent if possible
- [ ] Make theme responsive to terminal width
- [ ] Address font color discrepencies of prompt in VS Code terminal

### Software Installations to Consider
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] Homebrew
- [ ] vifm
    - [ ] add image previews to vifm
- [ ] sshfs
- [ ] pandoc
- [ ] batcat
- [ ] grip
- [ ] ncal
